# Shortest Path using BFS

## Overview

This folder contains a program that finds the shortest path between two nodes
of a graph using Breadth First Search.

### Execution steps

To run and test it out for yourself, follow these steps:

```bash
$ make
$ ./shortest_path
All tests passed!
```

**Note:** The vertices are numbered [1, n]. And the graph implemented here is
undirected. The program has been tested for the following graph:

               2 --- 4 --- 9                             5
              /     /|    /                            / |
             /     / |   /                            /  |
            1     /  |  /                            3   |   10
             \   /   | /                              \  |  /
              \ /    |/                                \ | /
               6 --- 7                                   8
