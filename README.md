# Stanford Algorithms Specialization

This repository contains solutions to all programming assignments that are part
of Stanford's Algorithms Specialization.

## Structure

This specialization contains 4 parts, namely:

- [Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer)
- [Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures)
- [Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-greedy)
- [Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-npcomplete)

Each part contains content worth 4 weeks each.

The content of each part is mentioned in a README of its own.
